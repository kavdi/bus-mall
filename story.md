# Developer Stories
As a developer there are certain aspects of the project I would like to concentrate on.

  1. I want to make sure the user has a clear understanding of what is expected of them.
  2. I don't want too much redundancy in the selections offered to the user.
  3. I want to meet all requirements set by the marketing team for the page.
  4. Have readable efficient clean DRY code that any developer can read it easily.
  5. I want to style the page so it is attractive to the user.
